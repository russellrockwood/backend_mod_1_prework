## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - The SuperLearner article covered important habits that should be reinforced regularly. I do a relatively good job of taking care of my brain but there is always room for improvement. To view learning as a process is something I need to do more often especially with regards to programming. One useful learning habit I might add would be finding a social group where you can discuss and work on the subject matter.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

  -puts "Hello World"
  -print "Hello World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
  - #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  - An integer is a whole number and a float is a decimal.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

   animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  print animal
  puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  - Interpolation is a way to substitute the result of ruby code into the middle of a string.

  print "The #{animal} has black and white stripes."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  - use the 'gets' method to get input from the user

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  - The length method will return the length of a given string
  - to_i will convert a string to an integer or return 0 if the string contains no numbers.
