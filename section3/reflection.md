## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * The term 'Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)' is new to me but I feel like we all have an intuition for it. Behind the ZPD is when you are not challenged and thus not growing much whereas too far beyond you might feel lost. I think moving just beyond what you are comfortable with is will keep you engaged and growing.
  * _Understand that mistakes are critical to learning._ This point resonates with me because mistakes are inevitable while learning software development and learning to embrace them as avenues for improvement is the best approach.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I think I do a decent job of understanding that mistakes are an essential part of learning. One aspect of the growth mindset with room for improvement is setting S.M.A.R.T goals. Having a clearer picture of where I want to be and when will greatly improve my learning.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  - A hash is a data structure consisting of key and value pairs. One way they differ from Arrays is that you reference the value by using its key instead of index position.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  - `pet_store = {fish_tanks: 5, lizards: 2, dog_food: 15, toys: 30}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  - `states['IA']`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  - `states.keys`
  - `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  - `vehicle_info = {make: 'Ford', model: 'Focus', year: 2005, vin: 09384KEN323EF4, mileage: 58000}`
  - In the above example a hash is better then an array because you can reference what you know about the variable to obtain the information you need. You know a vehicle has mileage so you access the _mileage_ value `vehicle_info[mileage]` instead of sifting through an entire list of data.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  - One question I still have about hashes regards using symbols as keys and how and when to use this option.
